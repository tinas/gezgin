# Project introduction

### Target

Booking bike, scooters and electric cars in one application

### Overview

Nowadays, when we want to rent a bike, scooter or car, we constantly use different applications. So why don't we collect all these in one app?

### How does it work?

It registers through the Passenger web application. He makes a booking for the vehicle he wants according to the distance.

Passenger can leave the booking vehicle to either the rented station or to a different station.

Passenger pays a certain fee for every minute it uses.

The passenger can leave the vehicle he / she booked only at the station of that vehicle.

### Result

As a result, instead of using a different application for each vehicle (bike, scooter, electric car) booking, we will be able to do all transactions through a single application.
